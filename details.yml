intro:
  - Over the past years, I have worked on many different projects, from simple
    blogs to fault-tolerant event-driven systems. I have faced unique
    challenges, huge number of technologies and my experience can be of use to
    your business. Systematization, synthesis and interdisciplinary work is my
    strength.

  - There is a positive experience of forming a development team based on the
    Valve model. I know how to run the product through all stages, ~~from
    denial to acceptance,~~ from requirements to release. Both as a regular
    developer and as a team/tech leader.

  - Mostly I work with asynchronous Python backend but also enjoy working with
    frontend, have a strong development experience with React/Redux.

  - I love to use CLI tools like `vim`, `tmux`, `zsh`, `fzf` and other
    three-four letter words in my daily work. Ideally, this should convince you
    of my passion for efficiency and minimalism.

  - The author of the best Russian-language IT channel in Telegram (according
    to the author) — [Tipa Pro IT](https://t.me/tipaproit). This helps me to be
    aware of the entire industry. Have some relatively popular projects on
    GitHub and new ones are always coming up. I'm really into technology and also
    seriously interested in graphic design, UI/UX, philosophy and
    psychoanalysis.
